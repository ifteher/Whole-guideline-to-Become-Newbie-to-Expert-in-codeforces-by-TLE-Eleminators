1) Topic for newbie:
learn time & space complexity, STL, HCF,LCM,PRIMES,DIVISORS,MULTIPLES Etc TYPES MATHS,Modular Arithmetic, Recurstion.

2)Tips for Newbie: 
i) Don't run after topics
ii)Focus on Building implementation skills.
iii)Don't get disheartened(hotash hobena).

3)Topic for Pupil:
Advanced Binary search with monotonic function, level up Number theory(seive,Euclidean Algorithm***),advanced Prefix sum(with proper problem solving skill),Master standard Greedy Algorithm,Solve a lot of non-standard greedy algorithmic problems, Master in Bit manipulation.

4)Tips for Pupil:
i)get into the habit of solving ad-hoc problem.select random problem and then try to solve this.
ii)Get into the habit of Upsolving contests.
iii)Give enough contests.Because,Learning a Topic is not enough,you need to solve problems on it.

5)Topic for specialist: You should learn Two pointers and Sliding Windows,Advanced and Higher Number theory(Fermat's & Euler's Theorem),Modular inverse and Combinatorics,spend lot of time on Dynamic Programming***(Solve 50-100problem:1600-1700rating cf problems),DP with Bitmask, Learn very Advanced Graph problems(dfs,bfs,connected components,Diastra),Trees(basic subtree precomputation,Binary  lifting),Learn Segment Tree(sparse tables/fenwick trees).

6)Tips for specialist:
i)Start proving your approaches.
ii)Start Reading codeforces Blogs or other platform.(get improving habit of reading).
iii)Avoid learning Irrelevant topics.
